# Mohit Gera Portfolio

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

4. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## Configuration

Ensure the following files are correctly set up:

- `next.config.ts`
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`

By ensuring these configurations and scripts are correctly set up, the Next.js build process should generate the necessary `routes-manifest.json` file, resolving the error you encountered.
